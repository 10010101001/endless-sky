	description `A pair of Fleck Coilguns on a sturdy turret mount produces a powerful kinetic artillery piece capable of lobbing projectiles across an entire battlefield. An inductive energy recovery system allows the firing of one coilgun to prime the other instead of simply dissipating the charge as heat, making the turret more thermally efficient compared to its single gun variant. The sheer momentum behind each slug can inflict serious damage on any conventional material, though it is less effective against momentum-repulsion shielding technologies.`

	description "This compact phased array laser is actually a set of microscopicturret uses a set of individually targetable fiber lasers to create a single collimated beam. An azure glow strong enough to blind the naked eye is the only indication of this weapon firing."
	description "Unlike the beam weapons used by many species, which incorporate exotic fields to mitigate beam diffraction, this weapon's effectiveness quickly drops off with range. However, the Avgi have managed to pump enough power into this laser to render it a potent missile defense system, even if its damage against other ships is lacking."
	description "The lasing medium itself is a tightly wrapped coil of optical fiber, which would be more than a kilometer long if unraveled. This allows much of the laser to be stored internally inside the ship, with the turret itself merely containing the optics needed to aim it."

	description "The Sidereal missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't. By subtracting where it is from where it isn't, or where it isn't from where it is (whichever is greater), it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn't, and it follows that the position that it was, is now the position that it isn't"
	description "In the event that the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn't, the system has acquired a variation, the variation being the difference between where the missile is, and where it wasn't. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too may be corrected by the GEA. However, the missile must also know where it was."
	description "The missile guidance computer scenario works as follows. Because a variation has modified some of the information the missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it is. However, it is sure where it isn't, within reason, and it knows where it was. It now subtracts where it should be from where it wasn't, or vice-versa, and by differentiating this from the algebraic sum of where it shouldn't be, and where it was, it is able to obtain the deviation and its variation, which is called error."

	description "The Equinox makes no compromises with its design goal of fitting the largest thermonuclear warhead feasible.

A carrying ship must instead both accelerate and aim the torpedo properly to ensure a hit."

	description "Unlike the nuclear missiles employed by the Avgi, the Equinox carries only enough propellant to make small adjustments to its trajectory, and lacks the ability to accelerate entirely. It instead relies on the speed of the bomber carrying it, trading an independent propulsive capability for an oversized warhead."

This ramscoop takes that original ramjet design and strips out the thruster, modifying the fusion reactor to fuse raw hydrogen into deuterium while preventing the deuterium from further fusing. While the polarization process needed to inhibit deuterium fusion, a direct conjugate to the spin polarization that enables Avgi fusion torches, does make the reaction net energy negative, this ramscoop's ability to produce hyperspace fuel is unparalleled. However, it usually needs a dedicated reactor to run it, and is usually installed only on the largest Avgi tankers."
