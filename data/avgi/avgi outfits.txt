	description "This compact railgun rapidly fires a stream of hypervelocity projectiles, trading accuracy for sheer rate of fire. Friction between the projectiles and the rails is reduced via advanced techniques, but still produces enough heat that the gun must cool down after a burst of fire to prevent rail ablation."
	description "A small internal capacitor allows the Speckle Railgun to be trickle charged, even if a ship's power supply would otherwise be insufficient to fire a single shot."

	description "The turreted version of the Speckle Railgun mounts a pair of railguns onto a nimble swiveling base. Its light weight and minimal size allows even small ships to engage much larger targets at extreme ranges. By alternating the fire of each railgun on the turret, the required cooldown period can be staggered to let the turret maintain a constant rate of fire."

	description "Without the advanced insights needed to produce classical 'beam weapons' such as those used by humans and other species, the laser suffers from diffraction as it travels. This causes its damage to rapidly drop off with distance, becoming almost useless at its maximum range."

	description "Developed concurrently with the Photikon Torpedo Bomber, the Equinox Torpedo is a large, minimally guided thermonuclear torpedo that allows even small drones to pose a credible threat to a capital warship."
	description "Unlike the nuclear missiles employed by the Avgi, the Equinox carries only enough propellant to make small adjustments to its trajectory, and lacks the ability to accelerate entirely. It instead relies on the speed of the bomber carrying it, trading an independent propulsive capability for an oversized warhead."
	description "This pylon externally mounts a single torpedo, employing a small electromagnetic catapult to fling the torpedo towards its target."

This results in a ramscoop that is far more efficient in both fuel collection and energy use than the Electrostatic Ramscoop, but which is utterly massive in size. The magnetic stresses involved are so huge that a dedicated spinal mount is needed to use this ramscoop without tearing the ship apart."

Additionally, analyzing the albedo of passive objects such as asteroids can reveal the composition of surface deposits at a low accuracy."
