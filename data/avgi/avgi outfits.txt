	description `A pair of Fleck Coilguns on a sturdy turret mount produces a powerful kinetic artillery piece capable of lobbing projectiles across an entire battlefield. An inductive energy recovery system allows the firing of one coilgun to prime the other instead of simply dissipating the charge as heat, making the turret more thermally efficient compared to its single gun variant. The sheer momentum behind each slug can inflict serious damage on any conventional material, though it is less effective against momentum-repulsion shielding technologies.`

	description "This compact phased array laser turret uses a set of individually targetable fiber lasers to create a single collimated beam precise enough to target projectiles in flight. A verdant glow strong enough to blind the naked eye is the only indication of this weapon firing."
	description "Unlike the beam weapons used by many species, which are not just simple lasers, there is nothing to stop the beam from diffracting with distance, and as such this weapon's effectiveness quickly drops off with range. However, the Avgi have managed to pump enough power into this laser to render it a potent missile defense system, even if its damage against other ships is lacking."

However, the Avgi have managed to pump enough power into this laser to render it a potent missile defense system, even if its damage against other ships is lacking."
	description "The lasing medium itself is a tightly wrapped coil of optical fiber, which would be more than a kilometer long if unraveled. This allows much of the laser to be stored internally inside the ship, with the turret itself merely containing the optics needed to aim it."

	"sidereal capacity" -1
	description "The Sidereal missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't. By subtracting where it is from where it isn't, or where it isn't from where it is (whichever is greater), it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn't, and it follows that the position that it was, is now the position that it isn't"
	description "In the event that the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn't, the system has acquired a variation, the variation being the difference between where the missile is, and where it wasn't. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too may be corrected by the GEA. However, the missile must also know where it was."
	description "The missile guidance computer scenario works as follows. Because a variation has modified some of the information the missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it is. However, it is sure where it isn't, within reason, and it knows where it was. It now subtracts where it should be from where it wasn't, or vice-versa, and by differentiating this from the algebraic sum of where it shouldn't be, and where it was, it is able to obtain the deviation and its variation, which is called error."

	description "The Equinox makes no compromises with its design goal of fitting the largest thermonuclear warhead feasible. After minimalizing its propulsion system to little more than a few reaction control thrusters, the Equinox lacks the delta-v to make large changes to its trajectory. A carrying ship must instead both accelerate and aim the torpedo properly to ensure a hit."
	description "A thin coating of ablative polymer designed to defeat lasers was the only mass the Avgi were willing to allocate to armor, and as such the Equinox is easily shot down by most modern antimissile systems."

	description "Developed concurrently with the Phonon-class Torpedo Bomber, the Equinox Torpedo is a large, minimally guided thermonuclear torpedo that allows even small drones to pose a credible threat to a capital warship."
	description "Unlike the nuclear missiles employed by the Avgi, the Equinox carries only enough propellant to make small adjustments to its trajectory, and lacks the ability to accelerate entirely. It instead relies on the speed of the bomber carrying it, trading an independent propulsive capability for an oversized warhead."
	description "This pylon externally mounts a single Equinox Torpedo, employing a small electromagnetic catapult to fling the torpedo towards its target."

	description "Breakthrough physics research has allowed the Avgi to create advanced shield emitters well in advance of their previous ones. While baked into the ships of most species, Avgi starship construction is sophisticated enough to allow their shield matrices to be retrofitted with relative ease."
	description "Warding Scales take advantage of special external hardpoints built into most Avgi ships, allowing them to be mounted without taking up any outfit space. However, they also tend to increase the amount of heat absorbed from the local star."

	description "A powerful bank of lasers ionizes the interstellar medium around ships equipped with these ramscoops, allowing electromagnets to collect extra material on top of the naturally charged solar wind. This results in a predictable supply of fuel, even around stars with solar winds poor in deuterium."

	description "With massive banks of superconducting magnets, extremely powerful magnetic fields grab ambient hydrogen atoms by their magnetic dipoles, channeling them towards a collection point without needing to first ionize them. This results in a ramscoop that is far more efficient in both fuel collection and energy use than the Electrostatic Ramscoop, but which is utterly massive in size. The magnetic stresses involved are so huge that a dedicated spinal mount is needed to use this ramscoop without tearing the ship apart."
