	description "The Koryfi is a light passenger transport whose basic design predates the invention of the hyperdrive. Originally restricted to intrasystem travel, its spin gravity system ensured a comfortable voyage for passengers long before the development of gravity plating. Today, it is a popular choice among independent captains for its high maintainability and ample living space, with many using them as permanent homes."
	description "Enterprising captains often exploit the commonality of the Koryfi and Avlaki designs, swapping out the modular centrifuge for a set of standard cargo containers."
	description "While its standard set of magnetoplasmadynamic thrusters give it an acceleration best described as sluggish, the Koryfi's constant thrust flight profile allows it to reach an impressive cruising velocity given enough time."

	description "The Avlaki is a mid-sized freighter loosely descended from a pre-hyperdrive solar-electric tug design. Its low cost and reknowned maintainability has enabled it to remain in service to this day, a popular choice among independent captains."

	description "The Photikon Torpedo Bomber-type is the cornerstone of Avgi antiship carrier doctrine. While it is possible for a swarm of Vibratia and similar interdiction drones to engage capital ships, it is the Phonon that is capable of delivering the nuclear anti-ship munitions necessary to bring down the largest warships. By bringing a nuclear torpedo within close range, the payload has a higher chance of surviving enemy point defense weapons compared with standard missiles."
	description "Phonons are occasionally used as gun platforms, mounting a Speckle Turret instead of their standard armament of a pair of Equinox Torpedoes."

	description "The Reverberance-class Missile Cruiser is a relatively recent, post-Evacuation design with a single focus: missiles. While its armor and shielding systems are fairly minimal, it can carry a staggering arsenal of nuclear tipped missiles, allowing even a single ship to dominate the battlefield - at least until it runs out of ammunition."
	description "A long truss running the length of the ship normally fits an impressively large mirror-cell fusion torch, giving the Reverbernace the mobility needed to evade opponents until they are reduced to hot vapor."

	description "The Lens-class Sensor Platform is the latest iteration of a long line of exploration probes developed shortly after the discovery of the hyperdrive. No longer limited to launching swarms of laser-propelled probes weighing a mere handful of kilograms, the Avgi built robust probes designed to quickly map out newly accessible star systems. Over the decades, these eventually shrank, and the duty of carrying them between star systems was offloaded onto the Crest-class scout ship. This left behind the modern Lens as a highly capable deployable sensor platform, used in both scientific and combat information roles."

	description "The Lumen-class Orbital Silo was first envisioned as a cheap static defense satellite, little more than a tube capable of storing and launching nuclear missiles. Over time, this specialization was broadened, and the modern line of Lumens is alternatively capable of mounting a large fixed gun, and carrying the energy supply to support it, in order to serve as in the ranged artillery role. Their mostly hollow construction provides a great deal of internal space for their size, but also makes the drone quite fragile."
	description "Lumens are usually seen defending important Avgi systems, ready to fire their payloads on any hostile ships that jump into the system."

	description "The Phonon-class Torpedo Bomber is the cornerstone of Avgi carrier doctrine. While it is possible for a swarm of Wavelets and similar interdiction drones to engage capital ships, it is the Phonon that is capable of delivering the nuclear anti-ship munitions necessary to bring down the largest warships. By bringing a nuclear torpedo within close range, the payload has a higher chance of surviving enemy point defense weapons compared with standard missiles."
	description "Phonons are occasionally used as gun platforms, mounting a Speckle Turret instead of their standard armament of a pair of Equinox Torpedoes."
