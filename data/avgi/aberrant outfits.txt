	description "This beam weapon somehow creates a field inside which otherwise stable atomic nuclei rapidly decay. This effect seems to be inversely proportional to the mass of the nucleus, causing isotopes like deuterium to break down at a higher rate than heavier elements. As the resultant fission products have a higher energy state than the original nucleus, this effectively cools the target ship, defying conventional thermodynamics."
	description "In aggregate, this can rapidly deplete a ship's deuterium fuel while also causing the very matter of its hull to decay."

# Systems:

outfit "Anomalous Shield Projector"
	category "Systems"
	cost 22000000

	"flotsam chance" 0.1
	"unplunderable" 1
	description "This emitter produces no detectable fields of any kind, yet a shield somehow springs into existence whenever something that could damage it comes near enough."


# Power:

outfit "Antimatter Power Cell"
	category "Power"
	cost 11000000
	thumbnail "outfit/antimatter cell"
	"mass" 32
	"outfit space" -13
	"energy generation" 9.9
	"heat generation" 4.9
	"flotsam chance" 0.1
	"unplunderable" 1
	description "This strange device seems to be partially organic in nature, slowly leaking antiprotons through a constantly-regrowing spongelike structure to release energy. The amount of power produced is inconsistent with the amount of matter and antimatter being annihilated, inexplicably producing more than should be possible."
