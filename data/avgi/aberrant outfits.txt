	description "This beam weapon somehow creates a field inside which otherwise stable atomic nuclei rapidly decay. This effect seems to be inversely proportional to the mass of the nucleus, causing isotopes like deuterium to break down at a higher rate than heavier elements. As the resultant fission products have a higher energy state than the original nucleus, this effectively cools the target ship, defying conventional thermodynamics."
	description "In aggregate, this can rapidly deplete a ship's deuterium fuel while also causing the very matter of its hull to decay."

outfit "Telescopic Antimissile"
	category "Turrets"
	cost 6000000

		"firing energy" 90
	description "Oddly enough, this antimissile system resembles an array of scanners and telescopes. Such an assortment of sensing devices was certainly not intended to be used as a weapon, but somehow enough power has been pumped into a scanning beam to make it a potent antimissile defense."
	description "The various lenses and mirrors that make up a large telescope seem to be used to focus the emitted beam, giving this antimissile system a very long range."


# Systems:

outfit "Anomalous Shield Projector"
	category "Systems"
	cost 22000000
	thumbnail "outfit/unknown"
	"mass" 8
	"outfit space" -25
	"shield generation" 3
	"shield energy" 6
	"flotsam chance" 0.1
	"unplunderable" 1
	description "This emitter produces no detectable fields of any kind, but a shield somehow springs into existence whenever something that could damage it comes near enough."


# Power:

outfit "Antimatter Power Cell"
	category "Power"
	cost 11000000
	thumbnail "outfit/unknown"
	"mass" 32
	"outfit space" -13
	"energy generation" 6.6
	"heat generation" 4.9
	"flotsam chance" 0.1
	"unplunderable" 1
	description "This strange device seems to be partially organic in nature, slowly leaking antiprotons through a constantly-regrowing spongelike structure to release energy. The amount of power produced is inconsistent with the amount of matter and antimatter being annihilated, inexplicably producing more than should be possible."
