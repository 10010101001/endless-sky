	description "This beam weapon somehow creates a field inside which otherwise stable atomic nuclei rapidly decay. This effect seems to be inversely proportional to the mass of the nucleus, causing isotopes like deuterium to break down at a higher rate than heavier elements. As the resultant fission products have a higher energy state than the original nucleus, this effectively cools the target ship, defying conventional thermodynamics."
	description "In aggregate, this can rapidly deplete a ship's deuterium fuel while also causing the very matter of its hull to decay."

	description "This strange device seems to be partially organic in nature, slowly leaking antiprotons through a constantly-regrowing mesh to produce anomalous amounts of power."
