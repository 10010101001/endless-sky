			`As you explore the spaceport of <origin>, you come across a small grassy park, the greenspace a welcome contrast to the otherwise industrial facilities. As the centerpiece of the park, where you'd expect a fountain or a statue in a human park, is a curious hanging windchime, made of pieces of colorful glass and various metals. You find yourself mesmerized by it as it rustles in the gentle circulation of the station's air.`
			`	"Is this one of the humans I have heard so much about, question?"` the translator at your belt suddenly speaks, responding to an Avgi voice. You turn and see an Avgi perched on a park bench behind you, his purple color faded with age. 

			He gives you an odd sort of salute with a forelimb, probably an Avgi greeting of some kind.
