			"Remembrance. The Aberrations tried to bombardment our cities early in the war, but our defense systems were able to shoot most of their projectiles down."
			"Remembrance. Much of my family was lost when the Aberrant destroyed our cylinder habitats. Only the Nisos Cylinder survived."
			"Pride. If not for our ground to orbit laser batteries, the Aberrant would surely have invaded the surface by now."
			"Sorrow. You can see the debris from our shattered skyhooks in orbit with the naked eye."
			"Anger. Why did the Consonance have to abandon our space? The surface of our core planets could have sheltered our ships, but instead they ran to save themselves"
			"Pride. Every time an Aberration comes too close, we hit it with half a dozen surface to orbit nuclear missiles."
