			"	You dock and the MHD Generators are quickly unloaded from your ship, a pair of technicians carefully guiding them onto a long cart. The Emergency Deployer is carried out even more carefully, a team quickly escorting it away."
			"	A few hours later you meet with Alizar in his workshop. Spread across one of the tables is what looks like an MHD Generator, dismantled into what looks like hundreds of parts. As you watch, a slim robotic arm mounted on the ceiling reaches down and smoothly picks up a curved piece of metal taller than you are, bringing it over to where you can see Alizar talking to a few other Avgi. When he sees you, he lights up in excitement."
			`	"Ah, Captain <last>! Many, many thanks for your help! This device is simply marvelous, ingenious!" He chatters on about fusion reaction chains and nuclear isomers until his forearms are playing too quickly for the translator to keep up.`

				`	"So, it looks like you've learned something from it?"`
				`	"How will it help your pure fusion bomb project?"`
			`	"You truly have no idea. This could perhaps be the greatest breakthrough in energy research in over a century, perhaps more!" He flaps over to the side of the workshop, where a small cylinder of a silver-white metal rests on a shielded pedestal.`
			`	"What's that?" you ask.`
			`	"The key to all our troubles, hopefully. Or at least those involving nuclear explosives," he adds as an afterthought.
`
			`	"Creating the conditions necessary for fusion is trivial - we've been doing it for hundreds of years in our reactors, engines, and stardrives. But to create a chain reaction, the kind that propagates and feeds itself even on unheated fuel, special conditions are necessary."`
			`	"The Emergency Deployer does not just launch the MHD Generator, it is able to trigger it as well. It injects a slug of Lutetium-177m - an excited nuclear isomer - at the edge of the reactor. It of course immediately vaporizes spun into a swirl that coats the walls of the confinement field, but the intense energies inside the reactor also trigger a state change in its nucleus, causing it to release a burst of gamma rays that immediately initiate complete fusion of everything within the reactor "`

				`	"What is a nuclear isomer?"`
				`	"So what does it do?"`
			choice
				`	"So, what are the Avgi like?"`
				`	"What do you make of their society?"`
			`	He looks thoughtful for a moment. "It's hard to say. The circumstances we've found them in... Well, it's unusual, to put it lightly. It's like asking an alien to judge human society during the Alpha Wars, but even more extreme- imagine if the Alphas had won and only some remnant of humanity was left. How could you tell what their society was normally like?"`
