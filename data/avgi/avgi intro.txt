This system appears unaffected however, and your computer is able to chart its position.`

			`	The aliens hum and chirp excitedly amongst themselves, the sound reminding you of a string instrument. You notice they seem to produce sounds not from any particular vocal organs, but by rubbing their forearms or legs together akin to a cricket. One of the aliens seems to hush the others, flaring their wings out before returning them to a folded position on their back. They then raise a curved, black instrument reminiscent of a violin bow, drawing it over one of their forelimbs for a moment before the device begins to speak in a synthetic, vaguely masculine voice.`

It's a bit awkward to be corraled by a group of people whose height barely comes past your knees, but you allow yourself to be escorted nonetheless. You exit through a ramp set in the floor, sloping downwards, then follow a long passageway that seems to perpetually curve upwards. You're reminded of older model space stations, ones that relied on spin gravity before gravity plating became commonplace.`
			`	Eventually, after a number of turns and descents, you pass through an open archway into some kind of conference room. Large and circular, with a high ceiling, it is occupied by a trio of multicolored dragonfly aliens, each perched on a metal ring running around a circular table.`

			`	Galano, interrupts, his translator's voice sounding aged, somehow. "Remembrance. But before all that, before the hyperdrive, we still crossed the void between stars. I was a child when the last true starship launched, but I remember. Long before we learned to surpass light, we settled the worlds beyond our home star system, at great cost and effort. We first touched space four centuries ago, and-"`
			`	He is cut off by Prasinos. "Rebuke. You should start from the beginning, long before we left Aviskir. Our ancestors made their homes around the springs in the valleys of the Fel Mountains, and spread across our planet for millenia. From fire to spears to the atom, our skill in turning the natural world to our will grew, and with it our ability to form civilization: Groups of Avgi bound together by more than close kinship or geography, instead by ideology and heritage and religion. And with that came conflict, each polity striving with the others to- "`
			`	Now both Asime and Galano make noises of dissent, and Galano, sounding rather hurried, interrupts. "Urgency. Perhaps we are not as united as you, the humans, and it is true that we have fought many wars among ourselves. Emphasis. But that time is long since past. We saw reason, and so the Consonance was created, governed by an Assembly of Polities to represent every division of the Avgi, small or large. From the nation-states to the ideolopoli, a consensus government of our species to resolve disputes, to prevent another Great War. And while there have still been wars fought by the foolish and shortsighted, there has not been a nuclear initiation on Aviskir's surface in more than a century. The Assembly, for all its faults, works."`

And those were the first, and until now, the only humans we have had the honor of meeting. A crew of explorers from, I believe they said, 'the depths,' though I am not quite sure if that is a planet or a region of space."

			`	Galano speaks. "Sorrow. The Aberrant, as we call them, remain enigmatic despite all they have taken from us. From where they came, we are not completely certain. They came two decades ago, from the east, beyond the reach of our knowledge, from a perilous region of space we have found difficult to probe. The scouts and explorers on the fringes of known space went dark first, and then the outposts fell one by one."`
			`	Asime continues. "Regret. When the Consonance finally took note, they swept away the ships Aviskir's polities were able to gather to oppose them. An entire generation of the Twilight Guard, wiped away in a single battle. Their technology is far beyond our own, and at the time it was impossible to oppose them. And the few Aberrations we were able to destroy baffled us. No crew, just a single organic entity inside. And systems operating on principles unknown to us. It can be said that we learned how to make shields from humanity, but we first learned what shields could do from the Aberrant.`
			`	Prasinos says, "Anger. And thus we find ourselves here. When the hopelessness of the military situation became evident, every ship with a hyperdrive was ordered to take on passengers and make its way into the Tangled Shroud, this confusing web of broken starways and shadowed space that we now must call home. We abandoned our planets to the mercy of the Aberrant with little more than their surface defenses, scavenging the orbital infrastructure that had been painstakingly built over the centuries."
			`	He is interrupted by Asime, who seems annoyed. "Clarification. We were not heartless. The decision to evacuate was only made once it became evident the Aberrant had little interest in orbital bombardment, and that our surface batteries could drive off the ones that did. And we took tens of millions of civilians with us, in cryosleep, to be revived as resources allow."`

			`	Prasinos says, "Assurance. Of course, we will introduce your fellow humans to you. But..." He trails off.`
			`	Asime continues for him. "Apprehension. The humans that came here before you, I must confess are still here for a reason. Perhaps they can give more details, but they have told us that when they first entered our space, they immediately attempted to turn around. For whatever reason, they were unable to. I do not know the means by which you were able to travel to our space, but perhaps you will be able to return, and take these stranded humans with you."`
			`	"Or, you may find yourself trapped here, just as they are. In any case, we will of course make you as comfortable as we can, as an honored guest, and treat you as we would any foreign dignitary."`
			`	"I have a Jump Drive that lets me travel beyond the hyperlanes, but it won't let me jump back to human space," you say.`
			`	"Regret. Then the situation is most unfortunate," she says. "Committment. We will offer you what help we can, but I did not wish to lie to you about their predicament, or provide you with false hope."`

				`	"While I'm here, can I buy your technology?"`
			`	Galano says, "Interest. I would expect human technology to be superior to our own in most aspects, but we will of course allow you to purchase items with your human credits, which we will back with our own currency with the agreement of the Assembly. In the event that it becomes possible to open trade relations with your human government, we may find it useful to have a small stockpile of currency available."`
			`	"Amusment. Not to mention the goodwill such a gesture could buy us," says Asime.`
			`	Prasinos says, more seriously, "Reservation. Our material resources are quite limited at the moment, so for now I would only support providing for the requisition of small items that do not strain the needs of the Guard. No military goods, at least not now."`
			`	Asime looks like she wants to object, but then Galano says, "Agreement. A reasonable compromise, one I can sell to the Assembly fairly easily. Beyond that, we will provide you with a line of credit with which to purchase housing and nutrition. I cannot vouch for its usefulness among... certain elements that do not recognize the Consonance, but anywhere else, you should find no issues."`

		`	You follow Kokkino's instructions to a prefab building in the spaceport, which looks to be some kind of command center. Kokkino is waiting for you by a table in the middle, which lights up, projecting a map of Avgi space in the air with some colored markings you can't read.`
			`	"Explanation. We send scouting teams and patrols into the space controlled by the Aberrant regularly. Every expedition beyond Evanescence is essentially behind enemy lines, cut off from resupply and in many cases communication. As you might imagine, such adventures are fraught with danger, and it is unfortunately not unheard of for a scout ship to be lost."`
			choice
				`	"Yes, I've found that exploration is often dangerous"`
					goto exploration
				`	"Sounds like you should build stronger scout ships."`
			`	"Agreement. The Polari are a fine line of vessels, but not one made for the environment of war. We have experimented with using the Prismaios as an intelligence platform in more contested environments, but it lacks the versatility and drone bays that has made the Polari so venerable in the first place."`

			`	He flicks his wings. "Regret. It is a sad truth, but those on the forefront of expanding our knowledge are often those who face the most danger from the unknown."`
			`	"But, to the point. A scout team, aboard the Polari-class scout 'Silver Albedo' was sent to survey the Twirl system two weeks ago, but has missed its check in by multiple days. To reach that star cluster and return would normally require a trip of weeks, all thorough perilous territory, and I am ashamed to say that we could be forced to consider writing off the scouts as lost. But I have heard that the visiting human, Captain <last>, is in possession of a new kind of faster-than-light drive, one that can travel without the need for starways. Tell me, is this true?"`
			choice
				`	"Yes, I have a Jump Drive. It can bypass hyperlanes entirely."`
			`	"Excitement. Then, the trip could be shortened to mere days, giving us the possibility of mountin a rescue. Are you willing to assist us with this, Captain <last>?"`
			choice

				`	"I'd rather not risk it."`
					decline
			`	"Approval. Excellent. I will mark the location of the Twirl system on your map, though it is probable that the Silver Albedo is elsewhere in the star cluster."
