			`The first thing you notice about this Earthlike world is the utter devastation in orbit. Your ship's sensors pick up the remains of what appear to be dozens of wrecked stations and countless destroyed satellites, forming a large swath of debris scattered in various orbits. A few larger objects are mostly intact, but lifeless, with no signal emissions or heat signatures. As your ship touches the upper atmosphere, you can see, even with your naked eye, glittering fragments of an immensely long tether slowly spinning in orbit.`
			`	Your observations are interrupted by a blared warning from your ship. You barely manage to yank your ship aside as a bright trail of plasma nearly clips your ship, the wake of a hypervelocity projectile fired from the ground. Clearly, someone is still alive down there, despite the destruction in orbit. Proceeding could be dangerous, if your ship isn't able to withstand a direct hit from those planetary defense batteries.`

A few larger objects are mostly intact, but lifeless, with no signal emissions or heat signatures. As your ship touches the upper atmosphere, you can see the tumbling remains of what looks like half of an enormous starship with an equally large drive, splintered and broken along its spine.`

			`	You make it no more than a few seconds before your ship is lanced by a rapid succession of shots from below. Your shields shatter almost instantly, your hull pierced as though it is tissue paper. You don't even have time to think before you are consumed by the rapidly expanding cloud of plasma that was once the <ship>.`

			label hit
			`	You make it no more than a few seconds before the <ship> is lanced by a rapid succession of shots from below. Your ship appears to be holding up under the fire, but the species that lives here doesn't seem willing to welcome you. When you detect the launch of a rather unreasonable number of missiles, you decide it would be safer to proceed back to orbit.`

			`	You make it no more than a few seconds before the <ship> is lanced by a rapid succession of shots from below. Your ship easily shrugs off the kinetic impacts, but the species that lives here doesn't seem willing to welcome you. When you detect the launch of a rather unreasonable number of missiles, you decide it would be safer to proceed back to orbit.`
				goto orbit

			label uninhabited
			`While this world is unsettled, you can clearly make out signs that it has been explored, and even exploited, by an alien civilization. However, the signs also show that something disastrous happened here. Ruined satellites litter low orbit, and you can detect the broken remnants of surface outposts smeared across the land below. You take the <ship> in for a close pass over one of the structures, and can see small craters and patches of glassed terrain scattered around it.`
				goto orbit

			label orbit
			`	Back in orbit, you are startled when another ship appears over the horizon, on an intercept trajectory with you. It doesn't look like any other ship you've seen before, appearing more than a little ungainly compared to the sleeker human ships you're accustomed to. You aren't sure whether it belongs to the same species that inhabits this space, or an entirely different one, but it at least definitely isn't similar to the hostile ships that seem to infest this star cluster.`

			label station
			`This alien station has certainly seen better days. While the bulk of the structure is still intact, avoiding the fate of whatever became the debris fields you have seen elsewhere, the hull is scored and chipped by what appears to be powerful weapons fire. The station's systems all seem to be powered down, as you can detect no emissions of light or heat. Without expecting to find anyone or anything alive, you maneuver near what you think is an open docking bay.`
			`	Just as the <ship> pulls alongside the 'docking bay,' you spot what looks like a ship tucked away inside. It is like no ship you have ever seen before, appearing more than a little ungainly compared to the sleeker human ships you're accustomed to. You aren't sure whether it belongs to the same species that inhabits this space, or an entirely different one, but it at least definitely isn't similar to the hostile ships that seem to infest this star cluster. What's more, its reactor is powered up and it seems to have an active shield matrix. It appears someone was indeed home.`

			`	You aren't quite sure how to proceed in communicating with a completely unknown species, but you transmit a standard hail, if only to assure the alien vessel that you're trying to signal it.`
			`	To your shock, however, the alien vessel responds after only a few minutes, not only in the same frequency band, but with an encoding your ship's computer is able to interpret: a standard human data format, similar to the one you've just sent. Either these aliens have an astonishing ability to decipher transmissions, or they have somehow encountered humanity before.`
			`The message is short and direct:`
				goto transmission

			label prime
			`	You can't expect a new alien species to be able to decode your transmissions, let alone understand your language, so you transmit a short list of prime numbers via simple amplitude modulated signals, if only to assure the alien vessel that you're attempting to communicate`
			`	To your shock, however, the alien vessel interrupts you just as you send the number "37", with a transmission not only in the same frequency band, but with an encoding your ship's computer is able to interpret: a standard human data format, similar to the one you've just sent. They must have somehow encountered humanity before.`

			`	"Salutations. I am of the Avgi. You human, question? Important. You will follow. This space, Twilight, not safe. You have hyperdrive, correct? Emphasis. Space we will travel is unstable, a maze. Follow closely and be careful."`
			`	The message includes an alien-looking star chart, pointing to a system far to the south. Something appears to have been lost in translation, as the hyperlanes leading there are mostly unmarked, labeled as "perturbed," whatever that means. Just as you are still processing first contact with an alien civilization, a group of the same ships that attacked you earlier jump into the system.`

			`After a confusing journey through the winding hyperlanes, you finally arrive at the system the alien marked on your map. You notice that your flight computer has failed to record the location of the systems you passed through, probably due to the same anomaly that made your ship almost completely blind within the region. This system appears unaffected however, and your computer is able to chart its position.`
			`	The alien ship pings you, indicating to follow as it flies towards what looks to be a large inhabited station in the system. Shaped like a circular disk, a large cutout in the center exposes hundreds of docking bays and what looks to be a spaceport. As you watch, a trio of sleek looking fightercraft launch from the station and take up escort positions around you and the other alien ship you have followed all this way. You can only assume your escort is in communication with the station authorities.` 
			`	Your companion speeds ahead, neatly pulling into one of the bays on the outer levels. When you attempt to follow, the fightercraft zip in front of you, herding you towards a different bay closer to the middle decks.`
			`	The docking bay is full of activity, and you finally get your first glimpse at this new species up close. They appear to be something analogous to an Earth dragonfly, or maybe more closely to a damselfly, maybe a meter and a half long on average. A group of them quickly close in around your ship as you finally land in a clear space, moving precisely. These aliens have clearly been expecting you.`
			`	None of the aliens look to be armed, but are arrayed around your ship in a clearly defensive circular pattern, both on foot and flitting about in the air. Some of them look to be wearing some kind of body armor, but they don't seem to be carrying any obvious weapons.`

					goto die

			`	The aliens hum and chirp excitedly amongst themselves, the sound reminding you of a string instrument. You notice they seem to produce sounds not from any particular vocal organs, but by rubbing their forearms or legs together akin to a cricket.`


			label die
			`	You draw your sidearm and begin firing at the group of aliens, who scatter in all directions. Your first shot glances off an alien's body armor, but your second burns a hole in a wing, sending the alien tumbling. You have little time to celebrate your victory, however, before a 300 kilowatt green laser turns you into a rapidly expanding cloud of hot vapor.`






			`	You are led into what you think is some kind of office, a small, round room with a high ceiling. Waiting there, behind a lectern, is another alien, this one colored bright green. It is perched upon a smooth metal bar, hung from a short stand by thin wires, but gestures towards a human style seat on the other side of the lectern. One of two seats, in fact, which puzzles you.`
