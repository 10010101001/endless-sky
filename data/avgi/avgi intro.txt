the x, a Mule that was sent off to scout away from the main fleet


New intro mission outline


You arrive at one of the occupied Avgi worlds, and as you land a scout ship happens to be making a risky supply run with you

It lands near you and you pantomime a bit to communicate, before the Avgi pilot (who becomes a main character later) gets you to follow them

A marker appears on your map and you have to escort it back to Meridian Station.

Your ship's sensors pick up the remains of what appear to be dozens of wrecked stations and countless destroyed satellites, forming huge bands of debris scattered in various orbits. A few larger objects are mostly intact, but lifeless, with no signal emissions or heat signatures. As your ship touches the upper atmosphere, you can see, even with the naked eye, glittering fragments of an immensely long tether, perhaps the remannts of some kind of space elevator.`

How could you tell what their society was normally like?"`
